I learnt the following codes while studying Python for data analysts.

## Quick Shortcuts 
* To switch between markdown and code you press the esc key+ m to switch to markdown then esc+y to switch to code and esc+r to switch to raw.
* Just like here on  a Github .md file , Python's md file has many similar syntax , i.e to add a pointer use an asterix  and space before the sentence.
* To comment multiple lines of code, highlight the codes and place Ctrl+/
* To underline a text in a markdown pane use {u in between the left arrow key and right arrown key u} just before the text. <<u>>. Similarly, to bold and italize a text use b and i respectively in side the left and right arrow key. To bold and italize a text, the use the arrow keys method above but enclose the entire text from both sides with double asterixes.
  ***<<u>>***
