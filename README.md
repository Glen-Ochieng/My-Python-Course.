# Python-Knowlegde.ipynb
Codes I learnt from my Python from data analysis course.

## Quick Shortcuts 
* To switch between markdown and code you press the esc key+ m to switch to markdown then esc+y to switch to code and esc+r to switch to raw.
* Just like here on  a Github .md file , Python's md file has many similar syntax , i.e to add a pointer use an asterix before the sentence.
