I learnt the following codes while studying Python for data analysts.

## Quick Shortcuts 
* To switch between markdown and code you press the esc key+ m to switch to markdown then esc+y to switch to code and esc+r to switch to raw.
* Just like here on  a Github .md file , Python's md file has many similar syntax , i.e to add a pointer use an asterix  and space before the sentence.
* To comment multiple lines of code, highlight the codes and place Ctrl+/
* To underline a text in a markdown pane use {u in between the left arrow key and right arrown key u} just before the text. <<u>>. Similarly, to bold and italize a text use b and i respectively in side the left and right arrow key. To bold and italize a text, the use the arrow keys method above but enclose the entire text from both sides with double asterixes.

## Common Mistakes
* While pressing Alt+Enter or Shift+Enter is an easy way to go to the cell below and automatically have it be in edit mode. This can cause an error message to pop if the above code was a code that did a non-reversable operation such as dropping or adding an element in your variable.
This is because the above command re-run that cell's code before creating the active empty cell below. Thus, it is less riskier to add a new cell by pressing the down arrow key and pressing Enter, using your mouse or pressing ESC+b then Enter. Another common programmer practice is at the beginning, add many cells then just press the down arrow key/click/press Enter the next cell.
However, press Shift/Alt + Enter when you have typed out your code and you are read to run it *just once* and go to the next cell.
